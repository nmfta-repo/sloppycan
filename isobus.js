// ── ISOBUS (ISO 11783) — the carlito `isobus` flavor packer ───────────────────
// The contract deliberately says a flavor borrows a protocol's signal names/semantics
// "without implementing its CAN frames - frame layout stays on the sloppyCAN side", and this
// file is that side for ISOBUS. It registers on window.carlitoFlavorPackers, which carlito.js
// reads for both packing and its checkCanCoverage assertion. Same bolt-on pattern as
// dronecan.js, minus the tab: ISOBUS is J1939 at the wire level, so j1939.js's existing
// decoder ALREADY renders every frame this file emits (switch its Mode dropdown to ISO 11783)
// and a second view would be a second, worse one.
//
// ── WHERE THE LAYOUT CAME FROM ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every PGN, SPN, resolution, offset, transmission rate, priority and preferred source address
// below was read off a primary source, never off a plan document - the dronecan.js rule, and
// the reason this file can be trusted at all:
//   - ISO 11783-7 messages (65091 / 65093 / 65096 / 65097): the ISOBUS Data Dictionary at
//     isobus.net, which is the standard's own electronic database.
//   - SAE J1939-71 messages (61443 EEC2, 61446 EAC1, 64991 FWD): the J1939-71 document.
//   - Preferred source addresses: isobus.net's SourceAddress table.
//   - The NAME bit layout: SAE J1939-81.
// FOUR of those lookups contradicted what this repo already believed, and correcting j1939.js's
// decode tables was part of the same change - each is called out at the point it bites below.
//
// ── THE COMMANDS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This file also OWNS the tractor's seven contract dir="in" signals - hitch, PTO, PTO mode, diff
// lock, MFWD, guidance curvature and SCV flow - the way dronecan.js owns its gimbal sliders: one
// state per signal, fed by tractor.js's widgets (window.isobusSetCtl) AND by the real ISO 11783-7
// command frames off the bus (65090 Hitch and PTO commands, 44288 Guidance System command, 65072
// Auxiliary valve 0 command), leaving through carlito.js's uplink registry. See the section of
// that name below for the freshness rule and for the two with no decoder.
//
// INTEGRATION POINTS - the only changes required in the main files:
//   index.html           <script src="isobus.js" defer> after carlito_contract.js and BEFORE
//                        carlito.js (the packer, the uplink sources and the uplink decoder must
//                        be registered by the time carlito.js evaluates)
//   carlito-bridge.html  same script tag. That page loads neither sloppycan.js nor j1939.js,
//                        so every cross-module read here is typeof-guarded.
//   j1939.js             decode-table corrections, so the frames render named and scaled
//   tractor.js / truck.js  their controls are views over window.isobusCtl / isobusSetCtl
//
// Telemetry TX rides carlito.js's canForward gateway, which is what puts these on the wire and
// in the dump as FW entries. No transport code here.

  // One state per signal: { panel, bus, at }. The source is the bus value while it is FRESH, else
  // the panel's, and a panel edit clears the bus value - so the last hand on the control wins.
  // Every panel value starts at the game's own absent-default (hitch raised, everything off, 540),
  // so loading this file changes nothing on the machine until someone touches a control.
  //
  // FRESHNESS: all three command messages are "100 ms when active" (isobus.net), so a command that
  // stops arriving is a command withdrawn. IB_CMD_TTL_MS is this side's own timeout - three missed
  // periods - not a number out of the standard. Each FIELD refreshes only its own signal, and a
  // field reading "don't care" / "not available" refreshes nothing: a guidance computer sending
  // only 44288 does not thereby lower the hitch.

  // transmits none of the three command PGNs, only the status groups that answer them.
