  "notes": [
    "Carlito signal contract. Defines every signal crossing the sloppyCAN<->game bridge.",
    "Signals are unique by (name, dir). 'battery' exists in both directions on purpose: in = warning LED, out = battery voltage.",
    "'type'/'unit'/'range' are packing hints; CAN frame IDs and byte layout live on the sloppyCAN side and are finalized there together with carlito.js.",
    "'warn' (optional number, added v3) is the danger threshold the dashboard highlights: the tachometer redline, low-fuel, coolant overheat. Which side of it is the dangerous one is DECLARED in 'warn_side' ('low' | 'high'), never inferred: the parser rejects either field without the other. Inferring it from the range was a trap - it made the dashboard's danger direction a silent function of whatever range you happened to pick.",
    "'flavor' borrows a protocol's signal names/semantics (j1939, isobus, iso11992, j2497, cleanopen, canaerospace, dronecan, train) without implementing its CAN frames — frame layout stays on the sloppyCAN side.",
    "'cleanopen' is the only flavor on a SECOND NETWORK rather than the vehicle's own bus: CiA 422 (EN 16815:2019) is a CANopen body-control network, so the garbage truck's body signals reach the J1939 chassis across a CiA 413-6 truck-gateway interface and appear on the truck's cluster per CiA 413-8. The gateway is the content — body_inhibit is computed from chassis state and published on the body network, and body_bus can be down.",
    "'iso11992' is the TRAILER bus (ISO 11992-2 over pins 6 and 7 of the ISO 7638 connector), and how LITTLE rides it is the content: part 2 is the application layer for brakes and running gear only, so a coupling claim, the brake demand going out (EBS11), the ABS state coming back (EBS21), an axle load and an injectable fault are the ENTIRE boundary. It is the one signal group here that is bidirectional by design, and it deliberately carries no body type at all — see trailer_connected. Contrast 'cleanopen' above: the body network is thick (a second bus with its own profile behind a gateway), the trailer network is thin (four messages about brakes), and both are real.",
    "'j2497' is the REGIONAL CONTRAST to 'iso11992', and the contrast is a SUBTRACTION rather than a second set of messages: SAE J2497 (PLC4TRUCKS) is what North America put on the truck/trailer boundary, and it is not a bus at all — the ISO 7638 connector has no data pair over there, so trailer ABS status is modulated onto the POWER LINE and its payload is essentially LAMP ON / LAMP OFF to one dash telltale. So this flavor has exactly ONE signal (trailer_abs_lamp) and that single mirrored bit is the whole protocol. A tractor unit without the ISO 11992 data pair (VehicleSpec.trailer_bus_equipped false — the shipped 'semi-conventional') tows and brakes exactly the same trailer through the same pneumatic lines and publishes nothing about it: thin, thinner, and both are real.",
    "'j1939' and 'isobus' are parent and child: ISO 11783 (ISOBUS) is built on SAE J1939, so a handful of signals carry the isobus flavor and are shared with the truck — engine_load is J1939 SPN 92 whichever family reads it, and the tractor's was always the borrowed one. Signals the truck alone declares are flavored j1939.",
    "'train' is the one flavor that borrows PRACTICE, not a protocol: real trains run IEC 61375 (TCN/WTB/MVB, not CAN) and the CAN-adjacent CiA 421 profiles use an object dictionary that does not fit this flat (name, dir) model. The train signals are custom flat signals whose semantics are borrowed from rail practice / CiA 421.",
    "'nmea2000' is J1939 at the wire (the same parent 'isobus' borrows from), its long messages ride Fast Packet rather than J1939 TP, and frame layout stays on the sloppyCAN side like every other flavor. The asymmetry is deliberate: N2K's 127257 Attitude and 127250 Vessel Heading are carried here by the unflavored shared 'pitch'/'roll'/'heading', because a flavor is a property of a signal and those signals also serve the plane and the drone. The flavor marks only what the boat alone declares.",
    "'count' (optional integer >= 1, added v20, default 1 when absent) makes a signal INSTANCED: its value is an array of exactly N elements of the declared 'type', and 'range'/'warn' apply PER ELEMENT. It exists because DroneCAN distinguishes instances with a field inside one message type (uavcan.equipment.esc.Status carries esc_index) rather than by defining esc1_rpm..esc4_rpm, and hand-listing the four would be exactly the duplicated signal list this file exists to prevent. The drone's four ESCs are the first consumer; the index order is the vehicle's own (DroneVehicle.MOTORS), zero-based, and the dashboard labels its bars with that same esc_index so a fault bit and a bar name agree. 'node_health' (v23) is the second, over a different index space (DroneBus.NODES) — which is the mechanism working as intended: an instanced signal's index means whatever the declaring subsystem says it means, and both are stated in their descs.",
    "'count' > 1 is REJECTED at parse on anything the readers cannot express: it is 'out'-only (the inbound path in bridge_source.gd normalizes each signal by hand, per name, and has no array concept), and it may not carry an 'enum' or be type 'bool' (both decode to one chip or one lamp, and an array would silently read as a truthy nothing). A parse error there is better than an instanced signal that publishes correctly and renders as a lie.",
    "'speed_limit' (added v21) is the file's first CONFIGURED 'out' signal: every other one is measured out of the sim or is a labelled model of something the sim did, and this one is a number the vehicle simply CARRIES. That is not a hole in standing rule 3 but the other side of it - the honest reading of a road-speed governor is the limit it is set to, read off VehicleSpec.speed_limit_kmh, and NOT something back-derived from the throttle. What the limiter does is separately visible in engine_load, which reads the governed throttle rather than the pedal, so cause and consequence are two signals that cannot drift apart.",
    "'slip' (v30) is the 'count' mechanism's first UNFLAVORED consumer and its first non-drone one, over a third index space again (0 = front axle, 1 = rear). The mechanism was built for the DroneCAN ESCs, and the fact that a car's two axles drop into it with no new concept is the mechanism working as intended. See its desc for why the mean it replaced was precisely the number that could not carry the reading.",
    "THE CONTRACT CARRIES A LAMP'S FLASH, NEVER A CLOCK. turnL/turnR always did, and 'beacon' and 'strobe' (v30) close the last hole in it: LampSet used to pulse the aircraft beacon off the wall clock - the only local blink anywhere in the project - purely because no beacon signal existed to mirror. It exists now, sloppyCAN toggles it, and BEACON_PERIOD / BEACON_ON_FRAC were deleted rather than joined. THE SAME RULE COVERS J1939-73's DM1 flash-1Hz and flash-2Hz LAMP STATES WITH NO NEW SIGNAL AT ALL: red_stop / amber_warn / protect_lamp stay bool and the source toggles them at the rate that states the urgency, which is how a real cluster separates an ACTIVE fault from a PENDING one and is what it reads too. A flash rate is a property of the source, not of the dashboard.",
    "No entries are \"status\": \"todo\"; a planned-but-unimplemented signal would use that marker.",
    "Contract edits bump 'version'; both sides warn on mismatch instead of failing silently."

J1939 SPN 74 'Maximum Vehicle Speed Limit' is the authentic signal, and the type is its wire form exactly: one byte, 1 km/h per bit, 0 offset, 0 to 250 km/h, carried in PGN 65261 (0xFEED, 'Cruise Control/Vehicle Speed Setup', CCSS) beside the cruise high/low set limits.

That is a deliberate choice over a latched standby button: it is what makes the pilot drivable from a keyboard, and a latch would need a release rule of its own. HEADING HOLD AND NOTHING MORE - no routes and no cross-track error, because a route is a whole waypoint system while heading hold is the teaching object; do not propose adding one.

PRESENCE IS THE COMMAND, the same rule 'rudder' and 'guidance_curvature' follow: when the bus sends this signal the pilot steers the bearing in it, and WHEN THE BUS DOES NOT SEND IT AT ALL the pilot steers the heading it CAPTURED at the moment it engaged. The target is only ever re-taken on an ENGAGE EDGE, so a bus that commands a course and then goes quiet leaves the pilot holding that course rather than abandoning it for wherever the bow happens to be. There is deliberately no in-band 'no command' number on the wire - every value in the range is a legal bearing, so a sentinel here would be a heading someone could steer to by accident, and the -1 the game carries internally for 'nothing commanded' never reaches the bus. That capture is why 'heading_target' exists as an out signal: with no bridge attached the local key can engage the pilot, and the echo is the only way to see what it settled on. The reading is used modulo 360, so 360 and 0 are the same bearing."

What the boom actually did comes back on the separate out signal 'sail_angle' rather than being echoed here, the 'nav_mode' / 'nav_mode_actual' shape. UNFLAVORED, and for a reason neither 'engine_hours' nor 'pitch' has: NMEA 2000 DEFINES NO SAIL PGN AT ALL, so any flavor here would name a wire that does not exist. Do not read the 'train' flavor as the precedent - that one borrows PRACTICE and is still a flavor; this is the 'engine_hours'/'speed_limit'/'wheel_slip' shape, a signal the game publishes with no protocol home. A RIG IS ANATOMY, NOT A FAMILY TRAIT: the signal is declared by the whole boat family because contract signals key on the family, but only 'boat-sail-a' carries a sail, and the two powerboats ignore this exactly as a truck with no refuse body ignores 'body_cmd'. Mirrored verbatim, absent = 0 = hauled in.

It draws '---' there instead of colouring it, which is the whole reason that widget exists - on the generated bar it pinned at the low end of a LOW-side warn and read as a permanent alarm over open water.

The level NUMBERS are the protocol and are shared by all seven vehicles, so the ladder is not re-labelled per vehicle; 'led' is the drone's indication channel and the one the arm tips light from. The airframe's OTHER status lights (flight controller, GNSS puck, one per ESC, the battery gauge) are not on this bus at all: each shows its own node's state, steady and with no timer, as the real hardware's own LEDs do. BRIDGE-ONLY, with no local key, unlike 'node_fail' and 'flight_mode': an LED colour is not a control you fly with, so there is nothing a keyboard cycle would let you verify that sloppyCAN's colour picker does not. With no bridge the arm tips sit dark, which is the honest reading of a bus that has commanded nothing."

THE SIGNAL DID NOT CHANGE, THE THING BEHIND IT DID. What is behind it: the key must be at Ignition and the pack must have charge left (both are master-switch facts, not checks - at Lock/On there is no powered flight controller to refuse anything); arming then happens on the RISING EDGE of the arm request with every pre-arm check passing; a disarm request is REFUSED while the craft is airborne (the landed predicate behind status bit 1 is the gate - a switch thrown in flight is a five-kilogram brick falling out of the sky, and every flight controller on the market refuses it); and the craft disarms itself a few seconds after touching down. Arming on the edge rather than the level is what makes that auto-disarm mean anything - the arm switch is LATCHED, so on the level the craft would stop its motors and re-arm on the very next tick under a switch nobody moved - and it is also what a real FC does with a latched arm switch. Everything rotor-borne (rotor_rpm, the blade spin, the vertical damper) is gated on the MOTORS rather than on this bit, because this flips in one tick and the props do not: a disarm spools them down over ~5*tau, still making decaying lift the whole way."

ERROR is deliberately unreachable: the craft has exactly two honest fault sources and they land on WARNING and CRITICAL, and a test asserts nothing returns 2 so a third source is a decision rather than a drift. IT CARRIES NO 'enum' AND MUST NOT: 'count' > 1 with an 'enum' is parse-rejected (see the 'count' note above) because an instanced enum has no reader - the dashboard chip path decodes with int(value) and would throw on an array - so the table lives in this desc instead. IT ALSO CARRIES NO 'range', WHICH IS A LAYOUT DECISION AND NOT AN OVERSIGHT. A range would put it on the generated-bar path as eight indexed bars, and it was tried: eight bars plus a caption is nine rows on a cluster that already generates twenty-four, which pushed the drone from two bar columns to three and the gauges past the edge of the panel on a 1280-wide window.

Killing the GNSS node outright still drops a LOITER within that second.

THE RANGE TOP IS THE GEOFENCE RADIUS, not a round number - the bar fills as the fence approaches and pins when it is crossed, which is the only full scale this distance has. The fence is SOFT: breaching 400 m horizontally, or 120 m ABOVE HOME, latches a command to RTL and does not stop, brake or teleport the aircraft; WorldBounds remains the hard last-resort wall. 400 m is a genuine visual-line-of-sight distance chosen against the 2000 x 2000 m map - ArduPilot's own 150 m FENCE_RADIUS default would turn ordinary exploring into a permanent RTL - and 120 m is the real EU and US recreational ceiling, measured from home rather than from sea level so a launch on a mountainside gets the same air as one on the beach. Changing the mode releases the latch, so the pilot is never trapped. warn 360 is 0.9 of the radius. THE RANGE IS A SCALE, NOT A CLAMP: the published value is the real distance and can exceed 400 (the bar pins, the number does not), because the fence's RTL is refusable - with the GNSS node down it degrades to ALT_HOLD and the pilot keeps flying, out to the 2000 x 2000 m map's own diagonal.

BLOCKED therefore needs BOTH a powered aircraft and a raised arm switch, because a refusal needs a request to refuse - at key Lock or On there is no flight controller judging anything, so an unpowered craft reads DISARMED rather than claiming a judgement nothing made.

Bit 0 ATTITUDE: |pitch| or |roll| over 10 degrees, about a third of the airframe's own tilt limit - park on a hill and arming is refused. Bit 1 BATTERY: soc under 25 %, deliberately ABOVE the 20 % low-battery failsafe, because arming at exactly the failsafe threshold means taking off already inside one. Bit 2 ESC: at least one of the four ESC nodes is off the bus (node_fail), so the mixer has fewer than four motors. Bit 3 AHRS: the AHRS node is off the bus - nothing self-levels without an attitude solution. Bit 4 STICK: the climb axis is not centred; a stick left deflected is a craft that leaps on arming. Bit 5 FAILSAFE: a failsafe is already active and the 'failsafe' signal names it - an aircraft may not launch into a condition it would immediately have to react to. Bit 6 GPS: the selected flight_mode needs a 3D fix and there is not one - GATED ON THE MODE, which is ArduPilot's own rule rather than a shortcut, because a STABILIZE or ALT_HOLD takeoff needs no receiver at all and refusing one under a harbour roof would make the fix a permission slip instead of a capability. The bits are frozen the way 'status' is: a new check appends at bit 7 and never renumbers an existing one. IT PUBLISHES 0 WHILE ARMED, and that is not a gap: a flying aircraft deflects its climb stick and leans past ten degrees constantly, so live bits in flight would light STICK and ATTITUDE through every manoeuvre and make the signal unreadable in exactly the state it has nothing to say about - a real flight controller stops running its pre-arm checks the moment it arms, for this reason. It carries no range and no enum (a bitfield's values are combinations, which an enum table cannot describe), so like esc_fault and node_online it falls through every dashboard branch and renders NOWHERE today; it still publishes to the bridge, and decoding it is sloppyCAN's side of the paired change."

ONE VALUE, MOST SEVERE WINS, and severity is BY THE ACTION FORCED rather than by the enum ordinal (the ordinals are a stable wire enum and nothing more): LAND, meaning come down here and now, outranks RTL, meaning come home, which outranks a bare degradation. In order: MOTOR (an ESC node is off the bus - the airframe has already lost control authority it cannot get back, since a quad on three motors cannot hold yaw, so it outranks even a critical pack; forces LAND), BATT_CRIT (soc under 10 %, no flying home on this much charge; forces LAND), BATT_LOW (soc under 20 %, which is also the soc bar's own warn threshold so the bar turns danger exactly when the aircraft decides to come home; forces RTL), GEOFENCE (the soft 400 m / 120 m fence has latched - it READS the RTL the fence is already commanding rather than forcing a second one, so it still cannot interrupt a landing in progress), GPS_LOST (a mode that uses a position fix, without one - it forces nothing either, because the mode ladder already refuses LOITER and RTL into ALT_HOLD, and this is also the one reading LAND has for a landing that has lost its position hold and is drifting down). A FORCED MODE ARRIVES THROUGH 'mode_actual' AND NOWHERE ELSE, over the top of both the pilot and the fence, and it can only ever ESCALATE - so a low pack that commands RTL with no fix still degrades honestly to ALT_HOLD instead of pretending to fly home. IT IS EVALUATED ARMED OR NOT: the ground cases are what the pre-arm FAILSAFE bit reads, and they are not redundant with the other pre-arm checks even where they overlap, because the pre-arm battery threshold (25 %) asks 'is there enough charge to launch' while BATT_LOW asks 'is there enough to stay up'. A FAILSAFE IS NOT A LATCH AND CANNOT BE DISMISSED: changing the flight_mode releases the fence and the RTL landing leg, but a flat pack or a dead motor clears only when its cause does (restore the node with node_fail, or respawn for a fresh pack).
